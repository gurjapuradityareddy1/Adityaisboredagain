    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
I’m a technical writer with a software engineering background. I work closely with engineering teams to create documentation that’s clear, structured, scalable, and easy to maintain. The kind developers can trust, bookmark, and come back to without cursing.
I also occasionally write about random tech thoughts, systems, and things I probably should’ve documented earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy working close to engineering teams, translating complex systems
      into documentation that developers can trust and return to.
    </p>
     <p> 
        In case you’re hiring a technical writer to fix your documentation 
        or someone who can sit with engineers, untangle complex systems, and turn them into docs people actually read — you’re in the right place.
